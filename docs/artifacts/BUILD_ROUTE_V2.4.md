## 6.9 — Foundation Surface Ready Trigger (Unblocks 2.16.5C)

**Deliverable:**
Declare that the minimum Foundation database surface exists so invariant testing can be executed.

**DoD:**

* Core Foundation tables exist.
* Tenancy model baseline exists.
* Roles/RLS baseline implemented.
* Activity log write path exists.
* Foundation schema is runnable in CI/local clean-room.

**Outcome:**

* This item **unblocks Build Route 2.16.5C — Foundation Invariants Suite**.
* 2.16.5C must be executed and closed immediately after 6.9 before further Foundation expansion.

**Proof:**
\docs/proofs/6.9_foundation_surface_ready_<UTC>.log\

**Gate:**
merge-blocking (security)
