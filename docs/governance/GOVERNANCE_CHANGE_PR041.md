## Build Route Item
6.2 — SECURITY DEFINER Safety [HARDENED]

## Governance Surface Touched
- docs/artifacts/BUILD_ROUTE_V2.4.md — updated 6.2 item: added original DoD (allowlist + pgTAP membership check), explicit proof path, and gate name

## Nature of Change
Additive only. No gate weakened. No policy removed.
Original DoD clauses (missing from prior version) restored.
Proof artifact path and gate name made explicit.

## docs_only
false — governance-touching PR per GUARDRAILS §2.15

## Authority
Build Route v2.4 §6.2 (as corrected by QA)
