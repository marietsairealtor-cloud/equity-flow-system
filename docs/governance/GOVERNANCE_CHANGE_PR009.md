# GOVERNANCE_CHANGE_PR009

## What Changed
- Added explicit governance-scoped path documentation and merge-blocking requirement section to SOP_WORKFLOW.md.

## Why safe
- Clarifies existing enforcement already implemented in CI.
- No behavioral change to runtime or deployment logic.

## Risk
- Low. Documentation alignment only.
- Risk limited to wording inconsistencies if incorrect.

## Rollback
- Revert changes to SOP_WORKFLOW.md.
