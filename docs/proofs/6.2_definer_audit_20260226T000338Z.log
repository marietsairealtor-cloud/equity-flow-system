--- Gate output ---

--- Allowlist state ---
{"version":1,"allow":[]}

--- Application SD functions in public/rpc (catalog query) ---

--- Per-function DoD verification ---
No application SD functions in public/rpc. DoD 1 (allowlist): PASS — zero unallowlisted functions.
DoD 4 (proconfig catalog check): PASS — no functions to check; gate logic verified against proconfig field.
DoD 5 (failure naming): PASS — gate names function and missing entry on failure.
DoD 6 (helper enumeration): PASS — no SD functions; no helpers to enumerate.
--- pgTAP negative proof ---
No application SD functions exist in public/rpc. pgTAP negative tests deferred per deferred_proofs.json (database-tests.yml stub active, conversion_trigger: 6.0/8.0).
RESULT=PASS
