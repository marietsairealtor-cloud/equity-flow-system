=== Execution path ===
IMPLEMENTATION + PROOF: ship-guard CI job did not exist. Added and wired as merge-blocking.

=== Section 3.0 Constraint #2 -- Green Gate Loop ===
green:once:  ALL GREEN: 1 consecutive pass(es) completed. (post-implementation)
green:twice: ALL GREEN: 2 consecutive pass(es) completed. (no edits between runs)

=== Gate design ===
ci_ship_guard_contract.ps1: structural assertion script (Option A per QA ruling).
Does not execute ship in real mode. Asserts guard logic exists and is correct.
ci_ship_guard.ps1: enforcement script called by npm run ship (renamed from ship_guard.ps1, pwsh-fixed).

=== Gate output (local run) ===
=== ship-guard-contract ===
PASS: ci_ship_guard.ps1 exists
PASS: ship-guard: branch enforcement exists
PASS: ship-guard: throws on violation
PASS: ship-guard: clean tree check exists
PASS: ship-guard: artifact diff check exists
PASS: ship.mjs: no git commit
PASS: ship.mjs: no git push
PASS: ship.mjs: no generators
SHIP_GUARD_CONTRACT_OK

=== DoD verification ===
[PASS] ship fails on dirty tree -- ci_ship_guard.ps1 throws on dirty working tree
[PASS] ship fails on disallowed branch -- ci_ship_guard.ps1 throws if branch != main
[PASS] ship fails if it produces any diffs -- ci_ship_guard.ps1 checks generated artifact diffs
[PASS] ship-guard is now a merge-blocking CI gate

=== Gate ===
Gate: ship-guard (merge-blocking)
Status: PASS
