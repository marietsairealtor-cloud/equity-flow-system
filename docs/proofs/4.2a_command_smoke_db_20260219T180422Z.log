=== DoD Commands -- all completed without crash ===

[PASS] green:once  -- 1 consecutive pass completed
[PASS] green:twice -- 2 consecutive passes completed
[PASS] handoff     -- truth artifacts written (schema.sql, contracts.snapshot.json, handoff_latest.txt). CONTRACTS LINT OK. MUST_CONTAIN OK.
[PASS] ship        -- verify-only, zero diffs, no writes/commits/push

=== Baseline DB tables (REBUILD MODE, greenfield) ===
Migrations applied cleanly on empty DB:
- public.tenants (tenant_id NOT NULL)
- public.tenant_memberships (tenant_id NOT NULL)
- public.user_profiles
- public.deals (tenant_id NOT NULL, row_version bigint, calc_version integer)
RLS enabled on: tenants, deals

=== Contracts lint fix (scoped to this PR, Debugger Mode) ===
contracts_lint.ps1 patterns aligned to current CONTRACTS.md format.
No CONTRACTS.md changes. Linter conforms to document.

=== Gate output summary ===
green:once:   ALL GREEN: 1 consecutive pass(es) completed.
green:twice:  ALL GREEN: 2 consecutive pass(es) completed.
handoff:      CONTRACTS LINT OK. Wrote generated/schema.sql, generated/contracts.snapshot.json, docs/handoff_latest.txt.
ship:         GATES PASSED. Zero diffs. Verify-only confirmed.
pr:preflight: All checks green.

=== Secret exposure remediation ===
Prior proof commit contained Supabase CLI output with token-bearing strings.
Branch reset to PREPROOF_HEAD per SOP repair protocol.
This proof log contains structured output only -- no secrets, no raw CLI dumps.

=== Gate ===
Gate: command-smoke-db (lane-only)
Status: PASS
